description: From my first PR to VueUse to joining the Vue team, a look back at my open-source journey.
---

In March 2022, I wrote a ~~rambling~~ [self-introduction](https://gist.github.com/sxzz/2ffb940cbc472e4e7a3ef9479a170e6f) to summarize my technical experience before college. If you haven't read it, go read that one first and then come back.

Now it's time to talk about my open-source story ~~ramble~~ 😎!

## Getting Started <sub>2020, Age 18, Freshman</sub>

Back to the timeline in that earlier post -- 2020, the first year of the pandemic, and the year I took the college entrance exam. After entering university, life was much freer than in high school. I had more time to explore and tinker with what I really wanted to do.

In September 2020, Vue released the official 3.0 version. The Composition API really clicked with me, and I started paying close attention to the ecosystem around it. I also tried it in my own projects.

Later I used [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/). It wasn't very mature at the time, and I found some small issues while using it, so I quickly opened a PR on GitHub. I became interested in the project and eventually submitted six PRs. This was the spark that got me into the open-source community. I also got to know [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) a bit 😇.

Overall, in 2020 I was just interested in open source, but most of my time still went to maintaining my own projects. I had already gotten pretty used to filing issues and PRs on GitHub when problems came up🤣.

## First Attempts <sub>2021, Age 19, Sophomore</sub>

A year had passed since Vue 3 was released, but my own projects were still on Vue 2. I wanted to migrate to Vue 3, but migrating from Vue 2 + Element UI to Vue 3 + Element Plus was extremely painful back then, so I had to keep using Vue 2.

Later [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) tweeted that he made [unplugin-vue2-script-setup](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue2-script-setup), which brought `<script setup>` to Vue 2. With that plugin, Vue 2 finally felt a bit like today's Vue 2.7. I asked in the replies whether it could support ref sugar take 2 (now called Reactivity Transform), and he said they'd wait until the proposal stabilized (it's 2023 now, Vue 2.7 is out, and Reactivity Transform still isn't stable 😅). I felt that proposal was going nowhere (and I was right 🤓), so I submitted a PR to implement it myself. Anthony later tweeted and @-mentioned me; I felt super accomplished.

That was my first time getting recognition in open source 🤩.

### Element Plus

That summer, I finally upgraded one of my projects to Vue 3, and naturally moved from Element UI to Element Plus. During the migration I found some issues, opened an issue, and the maintainers encouraged me to fix it myself -- so I opened a PR.

With some prior contribution experience, I asked if I could help maintain the library. I got a positive reply and was ~~tricked~~ invited to become a maintainer, officially stepping onto the ~~point-of-no-return~~ open-source path 😆! (In reality, I was just burned out on business code 🤫)

When I joined the Element Plus team, it was still in the 1.x beta stage with bugs and ancient code. While reading the codebase, I aggressively submitted PRs and started a refactoring plan: switched TypeScript to strict mode, rebuilt the build pipeline, and more. Since I had previously maintained projects alone, the community members were super helpful. They walked me through GitHub workflows and how open-source collaboration actually works.

Looking back now, this was my first stop in open source and the first time I discussed projects and code with like-minded people. During this period, I spent almost all my spare time maintaining Element Plus -- after class I'd run back to my dorm to review PRs 🤖.

I learned a ton from the open-source community during this time and grew quickly. Because Element Plus is a Vue UI library, I worked with Vue every day and gained a deeper understanding. I also studied many topics I didn't know well, like Rollup, [unplugin](https://github.com/unjs/unplugin), esbuild, and ESM vs. CommonJS.

Many projects were born or discovered while maintaining Element Plus. [unplugin-vue](https://github.com/sxzz/unplugin-vue) is a Rollup plugin I wrote while modifying Element Plus build tools. [unplugin-vue-macros](https://github.com/sxzz/unplugin-vue-macros) was built last year to migrate Element Plus to `<script setup>`. I also contributed [unplugin-vue-components](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components) and [unplugin-auto-import](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import) to the official Element Plus docs.

In short, 2021 was my first year of serious open-source involvement. Over just a few months I submitted 200+ PRs and made small contributions to the Vue ecosystem, including [my first PR to Vue 3](https://github.com/vuejs/core/pull/5026) 😎.

## Hitting My Stride <sub>2022, Age 20, Junior</sub>

If 2021 was a great start, 2022 was definitely a meaningful year for me.

In February, after the Spring Festival, Vue switched Vue 3 to the default version on the seventh day of the lunar new year, and Element Plus released its first stable version. Behind the scenes, I was helping polish final details and docs during the holiday, and even [pushing releases](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus/releases/tag/1.3.0-beta.10) on New Year's Eve 🤣.

This year I contributed [my first PR to Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/6566). While migrating Element Plus to `<script setup>`, I submitted [my first RFC to Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/432). It was a huge honor to be followed by Evan You's two Twitter accounts.

In March, with help from the Element Plus team, I started GitHub Sponsors and received my first bucket of open-source income 🥳! So far I've been supported by 49 sponsors. Thank you all for the recognition and support ❤️.

Back in 2021 I had thought about live-streaming coding on Bilibili, but it was just talk. This year I finally did it. The trigger was [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) live-streaming; it looked fun. I occasionally [stream coding or chatting on Bilibili](https://live.bilibili.com/396708), and met quite a few friends!

In the second half of the year, I gradually shifted my focus beyond Element Plus. I hacked on some toy projects and kept maintaining my own libraries -- basically fixing things here and there and hopping on PRs 🤪. The personal project I spent the most time on was [Vue Macros](https://vue-macros.dev/). Through it, I unlocked some weird ways to use Vue -- an experimental Vue edition ~~(not really)~~. With this project I attended [Nuxt Nation 2022](https://nuxtnation.com/). Invited by [Haoqun Jiang](https://github.com/sodatea), I also joined [Vue Conf China 2022](https://vue.w3ctech.com/), my first time speaking in the Vue community. Unfortunately, due to well-known reasons, I still haven't been able to attend any in-person meetups.

I also recorded an episode of the podcast "Open Source Face to Face" ([episode link](https://osf2f.net/episode/S01E16)). It was my first time recording a podcast, so I was a bit stiff 🫣 -- please forgive me. After the recording, I also built the [official website](https://osf2f.net/) for the show.

The biggest achievement this year was [joining the Vue team](https://twitter.com/sanxiaozhizi/status/1586198256400285697)! I spent a lot of time contributing to the Vue repo, and with [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu)'s nomination, I became a Vue team member. It's a huge recognition and encouragement. As the youngest member of the Vue team, I'm still quite green 🥬 and have a lot to learn. My understanding of Vue isn't deep enough yet, so I need to keep learning from senior members 🫡.

Of course, the open-source community isn't only happy moments -- there are also frustrating ones, like unreasonable issues. But after being involved long enough, I've built some immunity. I treat those issues as entertainment and post them online for fun. See Twitter [#迷惑issue大赏](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E8%BF%B7%E6%83%91issue%E5%A4%A7%E8%B5%8F).

In the first half of the year, the community project I participated in the most was Element Plus, which I already covered above. In the second half, it was [Elk](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk), a web-based [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) client built on the Vue stack. [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) created the project, and later I got bored for a while and he invited me in. I spent a period communicating frequently with teammates [Patak](https://github.com/patak-dev) and [Daniel Roe](https://github.com/danielroe), to the point that I was living on European time (GMT+1) 🤣. Through Elk, more people from the Vue community got involved! I learned all kinds of tech stacks: Nuxt, PWA, Tauri, and more.

## Thanks <del><sub>riding the hype</sub></del>

The biggest gain this year was meeting many friends in the open-source community -- [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu), [ShenQingchuan](https://github.com/ShenQingchuan), [webfansplz](https://github.com/webfansplz), [Haoqun Jiang](https://github.com/sodatea), [Patak](https://github.com/patak-dev), [Daniel Roe](https://github.com/danielroe), [Johnson Chu](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk), [LittleSound](https://github.com/LittleSound), and more! It's hard to imagine that the big names I looked up to in the past two years are now people I can chat with regularly ~~(talking and laughing! 🤪)~~

With the help of many friends, I achieved a lot this year -- it was a year full of accomplishment. I'd like to thank my sponsors and friends like Evan You and Patak. Thanks to their support, I received even more sponsorship, which means a lot to me.

## 👋 Looking Ahead to 2023

### 🚩 Goals

- Blog & writing

  I hope to renovate my long-neglected, weed-covered blog in 2023. Since it's so old, I haven't been motivated to write posts. I want to write more summary-style articles regularly to avoid another rambling year-end recap next year 🥲. I'm not great at expressing myself, so writing more might help. ~~(May your blog wander for half a life and return to being a GitHub Gist 🤣)~~

- Build an open-source project I'm proud of

  I hope to build a larger open-source project that I'm truly satisfied with 🤔.

- In-person conferences

  With the situation improving, there should be more chances to speak overseas in 2023. I hope to attend more in-person talks and conferences, and see you at [Vue.js Amsterdam 2023](https://vuejs.amsterdam/) 👋.

- Relocate
